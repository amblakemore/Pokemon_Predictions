To prepare the images used to train our model, we started by reviewing and cleaning the images from the original dataset.

- Any image that was irrelevant to the classification
- Any image with multiple Pokemon in the image
- Any Mega Evolution of the Pokemo

With the introduction of "Mega Evolution" in the new games, some of the original Pokemon were provided with new evolutions and sprites. All mega evolution sprites were removed from the dataset as they are considered an additional and more powerful evolution.

Images were removed in order to try and allow for better training for the model in order to best learn each Pokemon. Any images that were thought to have possibly cause the model to misidentify the selected Pokemon were removed.

In order to properly recognize each Pokemon as a specific class, each Pokemon was assigned a specific folder in a larger data set folder in Google Drive. This allowed us to load the images into he model and begin the training.

For any project, cleaning data is a critical process. In order to ensure that the model is learning is the most accurate and lead to the best results, we had to go through and manually look at all the images in order to remove images that were not relevant to the model or would cause confusion. However, for the amount of classes used in the model, we should have used more images. If we were to do the project over again, I would be more selective with images that I considered to be irrelevant and leave some of the images in to be used in the training.
